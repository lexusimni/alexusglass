# hey, I’m Alexus 👋

🧠 I make smart tools that explain themselves, check for red flags, and predict what’s next. Scroll if you’re curious !

### 🔗 Projects That Show Off My Awesomeness!

🧠 Whipped up a [**Smart Query Assistant**](https://github.com/lexusimni/mock-llm-tabular-assistant) that basically turns spreadsheets into ChatGPT. Ask it what’s poppin’ in the data ... it talks back like it’s got a degree.  

📱 Built an [**APK Static Analyzer**](https://github.com/lexusimni/apk-static-analyzer) that peels Android apps like an onion 🧅 and calls out shady stuff. If your app’s acting sus, my tool’s snitchin’!!!

📈 Dropped a [**Retail Sales Forecasting model**](https://github.com/lexusimni/retail-sales-forceasting) that tells stores what they’re gonna sell *before they know it themselves*. Crystal ball vibes but powered by pandas and Prophet.
